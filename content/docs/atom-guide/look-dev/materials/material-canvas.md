**Material Canvas** is a tool that allows you to create and preview custom material types and shaders by assembling node-based material graphs instead of manually managing and hand-editing multiple JSON files or writing shader code in AZSL. 

Material Canvas is built on top of the same foundations as established tools like Script Canvas and Material Editor. It provides many of the same familiar features and workflows.

This section introduces Material Canvas and describes the editor layout and its individual panels.

## Quick Start
To get started, launch Material Canvas to open or create a new material graph. 

#### Launch Material Canvas
You can launch Material Canvas from the **Open 3D Engine (O3DE)** Editor, or as a standalone application:   

- From the O3DE Editor, you can launch Material Canvas in two ways.
  
  - Select **Main Menu > Tools > Material Canvas**.
  
  - From a Material component in the Inspector, select **Open Material Canvas...** in the hamburger menu of a material slot.

- As a standalone application, launch the executable `<build>\bin\profile\MaterialCanvas.exe`.
  
  - This requires you to specify your project path as a command line argument.

#### Create or edit a material graph
You can create a new material graph or open an existing material graph from the File menu in Material Canvas, or from the Context menu in the Asset Browser: 

- From the File menu in Material Canvas:
  
  - To create a new material graph, choose **New**, New Material Graph Document. Then select a template as the starting point for your new material graph.
  
  - To open an existing material, choose **Open...**, Open Material Graph Document. Then select the material graph file from the browser.
  
  - You may also use the **Open Recent** menu option to select a previously opened document.
  
    - Material Canvas supports editing Other document types like Material graph node config files and shader source data config files. These will also appear in the recent files list.

- From the Context menu in the Asset Browser:
  
  1. Select a `.materialgraph` file.
 
  2. Then, right-click the `.materialgraph` file to open the context menu.
  
  3. Choose **Open in Material Canvas...** to open the material in Material Canvas.

## Central Window
Material Canvas and other Atom Tools support opening and editing multiple document types, documents, and views. The main views and content for each document will be displayed as part of the central window.

### Document Tabs
The top of the central window has a tab bar that displays a tab for each open document. The tab bar highlights the tab for the active document. You can switch between open documents by clicking on their title in the tab bar. You can close each document by clicking the X on its tab and perform other actions made available by right clicking on the tab. Tabs can be dragged and reordered but they cannot be undocked. Switching tabs will also update the inspector to display properties for the newly selected document.

### Graph View
The main document type in Material Canvas is the material graph. Each material graph document tab displays a gridded, graph view as the main workspace for displaying and manipulating graph nodes and connections.

## Node Palette 
The node palette displays a tree containing items for all of the nodes that can be dragged into and created on the graph. Dragging a node from the node palette onto the graph view will create the corresponding node on the graph. 

## Bookmarks
Use the bookmarks window to manage a list of bookmarks that have been added to the graph. Bookmarks can be added to the graph by right clicking and using the context menu in the graph view. Double clicking on a bookmark in the bookmark window will move the graph view to that position on the graph. 

## Mini Map 
Use the minimap window to view and navigate a zoomed out version of the graph view. 

## Inspector
In the **Inspector**, you can configure the properties for the active material. The **Details** group shows the material's material type and optional parent material properties. All other property groups depend on the material type and are defined in the `.materialtype` file. See the [Material Type Reference](/docs/atom-guide/look-dev/materials/material-type-file-spec/) for all the material types in Atom and the property groups in each. 

## Asset Browser
The **Asset Browser** allows you to search for assets across O3DE, Gems, and other project folders. In the Material Canvas, the Asset Browser is automatically filtered to show image and material assets. You can display more assets by changing the filter. When an asset is selected, a preview of the asset is shown on the side. 

## Python Terminal
With the **Python Terminal**, you can run Python commands to modify, import, and process various assets that the Material Canvas uses, such as shaders, textures, and materials. 

## Performance Monitor
The **Performance Monitor** provides an overview of the Material Canvas's run-time performance. It displays the frame rate, and the GPU and CPU frame times. This is useful to gauge the CPU and GPU performance of materials and assets.

## Viewport
Use the **Viewport** window to preview open materials. To preview materials in various environments, configure the 3D model and lighting setup (see the [Viewport Toolbar](#viewport-toolbar) and [Viewport Settings](#viewport-settings) sections below).

### Interacting with the Viewport

## Viewport Settings
The Viewport Settings window displays options to configure the Viewport properties. These properties control how the Viewport appears and which features are active. You can also create or edit configuration presets for the viewport model and the lighting environments. 

![Model Preset Browser](/images/atom-guide/materials/viewport-settings.png)

Viewport Settings contains the following settings groups:

### General
The General property group contains basic properties that are required by the Viewport.
